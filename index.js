   <li> At all times relevant herein, Plaintiff Sharon Tucker (“Plaintiff” or “Tucker”) was an adult, over eighteen years old, who resides in Queens County in the State of New York. <br><br>
  
  <li> At all times relevant herein, Defendant Engel Burman Senior Housing at North Hills, Inc. (“Engel Burman”) was a New York corporation.<br><br>
  
  <li> At all times relevant herein, Defendant controlled the employment of Plaintiff and was responsible for hiring, firing, scheduling, controlling, managing, supervising, and record-keeping as to Plaintiff’s employment, among other employment functions, and performed such functions as to Plaintiff. <br><br>
  
  <li> Upon information and belief and at all times relevant herein, Defendant Engle Burman owned/operated a principal place of business in Nassau County, New York located at 300 Jericho Turnpike, Jericho NY 11753.<br><br>
  
  <li> At all times relevant herein, Plaintiff was employed by Defendant. 
  </p>
  
  <center> <b><h1> STATEMENT OF FACTS </b></h1></center> 
    <li> Upon information and belief, and at all relevant times herein, Defendant was in the business of providing in relevant part, housing and medical care to the public. <br><br>
  
  <li> Upon information and belief, and at all relevant times herein, Defendant employed over approximately 130 employees. <br><br>
  
  <li> Plaintiff was employed by Defendant for about 12 years ending on or about November 28, 2022. <br><br>
  
  <li> At all times relevant herein, Defendant employed Plaintiff as a manual worker performing a variety of manual and physical duties such as providing assistance to residents throughout her workday with Defendant, including filing, document handling/processing, transporting food up and down several floors for patients, moving boxes/parcels, etc.  <br><br>
  
  <li> At all times relevant herein, Plaintiff was an hourly employee of Defendant and her last hourly rate of pay was about $23.46 an hour. <br><br>
  
  <li> At all times relevant herein, Plaintiff worked about 45-60 or more hours each week; 5-6 days a week for Defendant - with the exception of about 3-4 weeks each year. <br><br>
  
  <li> At all times relevant herein, Defendant had a policy and practice of improperly deducting about 30 minutes or more each day from Plaintiff’s work time. However, due to the demands of her job, Plaintiff did not receive a “bona fide” meal break within the meaning of the FLSA and NYLL – as further reflected in the time records. 29 C.F.R. § 785.18; 29 C.F.R. § 785.19. As a result, Plaintiff is owed overtime wages for about 2.5-3 overtime hours worked each week during her employment with Defendant - with the exception of about 3-4 weeks each year, which she seeks to recover with this action and for which she was not paid any wages. <br><br>
  
  <li> A more precise statement of the hours and wages may be made when Plaintiff obtains the wage and time records Defendant was required to keep under the FLSA and NYLL. Accurate copies of Plaintiff’s wage and time records that Defendant was required to keep pursuant to 29 USC § 211, 29 CFR § 516 and NYLL § 195, 12 NYCRR §142, are incorporated herein by reference. <br><br>
  
  <li>	At all times relevant herein and for the time Plaintiff was employed by Defendant, Defendant failed and willfully failed to pay Plaintiff an overtime rate of at least 1.5 times her regular rate of pay for each and all hours worked in excess of forty hours each week during her employment with Defendant. <br><br>
  
  <li>	At all times relevant herein and except for the about the last year of her employment with Defendant, Defendant paid Plaintiff later than weekly - on a bi-weekly basis in violation of NYLL § 191 (1)(a)(i). See i.e. Vega v. CM & Assocs. Constr. Mgmt., LLC, 175 A.D.3d 1144, 107 N.Y.S.3d 286 (1st Dep’t, 2019). <br><br>
  
  <li>	At all times relevant herein, Defendant did not provide Plaintiff with the notice(s) required by NYLL § 195(1). See i.e. Alonso Vazquez v. Azoulay, 834 F. App'x 653, 654 (2d Cir. 2021). <br><br>
  
  <li>	Upon information and belief, and at all relevant times herein, Defendant failed to display federal and state minimum wage/overtime posters as required by the FLSA and NYLL (29 CFR 516.4; 12 NYCRR 142-2.8), and Defendant failed to notify Plaintiff of her federal and state minimum wage and overtime rights and failed to inform Plaintiff that she could seek enforcement of such rights through the government enforcement agencies. As such, equitable tolling applies in this case. See i.e. Veltri v. Building Service 32B-J Pension Fund, 393 F.3d 318, 324 (2d Cir. 2004); Kim v. Kum Gang, Inc., No. 12 CIV. 6344 MHD, 2015 WL 2222438, at 33–34 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 19, 2015). <br><br>
  
  <li>	The circumstances of Defendant’s termination of Plaintiff’s employment and other aspects and conditions of Plaintiff’s employment are under review and investigation and Plaintiff may assert wrongful termination and other claims at a later time. <br><br>
  
  <li>	“Plaintiff” as used in this complaint refers to the named Plaintiff. <br><br>
  
  <li>	The “present” or the “present time” as used in this complaint refers to the date this complaint was signed.<br><br>
